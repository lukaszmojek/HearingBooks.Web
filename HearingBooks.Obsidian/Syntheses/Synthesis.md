## Synthesis
Is a process of createing an audio file from the given text or file.
We can distingush following types of the syntheses:
- [[PlainTextSynthesis]]
- [[NarrativeSyntesis]]
- [[EpubSyntesis]]

Each of them needs to be checked on the side of potential viruses, before starting the synthesis itself. Some malicious users would be able to extract data from the platform, which needs to be prevented.
This functionality is provided by [[ClamAV]]
