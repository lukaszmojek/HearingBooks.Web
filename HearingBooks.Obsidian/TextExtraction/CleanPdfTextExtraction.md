#textExtraction
## Clean PDF text extraction
This is more complex version of the [[PhotoTextExtraction]].
Firstly the PDF is going to be separated into pages, so it will be broken down to image files. Once that is achieved, then [[PhotoTextExtraction]] will be used to extract the text from all of the image files, and put them into the **.txt** files containing text for individual images.
As a last step, all of the text files will be conmbined into one, keeping in mind the actual order of the pages and voila, text has been extracted successfully.

For now it was made as a proof of concept, that it actually can be done using those steps

To split the PDF into the images, running
`pdftoppm -png {name}.pdf {name_of_output_files}`

Then executing this script
```
#!/bin/bash

for file in $(ls -a | grep ".png")

do

	echo $file

	tesseract $file $file -l pol

done

```

Finally, running this command
`cat {name}.txt > complete.txt`

The process overall seems simple, but containting that functionality inside a C# application placed in docker conatiner might not be as easy as it sounds.
