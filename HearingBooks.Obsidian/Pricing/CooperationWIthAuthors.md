## Cooperation with authors
To make that more convinient for the smaller authors to not only have e-books available but also audio books of their creations, there should be arrengement between our parties.
When author agrees to cooperate with HearingBooks, he agrees, that we will be taking 30% of the income from the audiobooks generated for him.


### Scenarios:

#### Buying audiobook by the user
The user buys audiobook, which price is dependant on the cost of the creation of the audiobook, so basically, on how long it actually is. From this price author of the book would receive 70% cut, while HearingBooks would receive 30% 

ex. user buys audiobook for the price of 10 USD, out of which author is getting 7 USD and HearingBooks is getting 3 USD
