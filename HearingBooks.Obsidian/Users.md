## Users
There are 4 different scenarions then it comes to users of the platform:
- **PayAsYouGo** - user needs to add credits to his account in order to be able to request syntheses on the platform. He only has access to his own requests
- **Subscriber** - user is paying a standard fee of 20 PLN (7 USD) and he gains access to the library of books and podcasts. User can still request syntheses, but in order to do so, he firstly need to add credits to his account, the same as **PayAsYouGo** would need to
- **Author/Writer** - novel writer, which wants to publish his book on the platform. We are paying for the half of the syntheses to make that attractive for him. Then he gets 60% cut from the sold books
- **HearingBooks** - basically administrator users. Can impersonate others to see, what users can see, cannot request own syntheses
